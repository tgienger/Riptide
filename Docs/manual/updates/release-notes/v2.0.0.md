# v2.0.0 Release Notes

Install this version with Unity's Package Manager using the following URL ([step-by-step instructions](~/manual/overview/installation.md#option-1-unity-package-manager)): `https://github.com/RiptideNetworking/Riptide.git?path=/Packages/Core#2.0.0`

It can also be installed a number of [other ways](~/manual/overview/installation.md#net-projects) for use outside of Unity.

For a full list of source code changes, check out the [version comparison](https://github.com/RiptideNetworking/Riptide/compare/v1.2.0...v2.0.0) on GitHub.

## Additions

- Added a documentation site.
- Made a [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RiptideNetworking.Riptide) ([#12](https://github.com/RiptideNetworking/Riptide/issues/12)).
- Made it possible to accept or reject connections by setting <code><a href="xref:Riptide.Server.HandleConnection">Server.HandleConnection</a></code>.
- Made it possible to send custom data when kicking a client ([#20](https://github.com/RiptideNetworking/Riptide/issues/20)).
- Made it possible to retrieve connected clients by their ID using <code><a href="xref:Riptide.Server.TryGetClient*">Server.TryGetClient()</a></code>.
- Added disconnect reasons.
- Added support for adding `sbyte`s to messages.
- Added support for adding custom types to the messages class, as long as they implement <code><a href="xref:Riptide.IMessageSerializable">IMessageSerializable</a></code>.
- Added an option to disable the timeout system for individual connections using <code><a href="xref:Riptide.Connection.CanTimeout">Connection.CanTimeout</a></code>.
- Made it possible to change the maximum message payload size using <code><a href="xref:Riptide.Message.MaxPayloadSize">Message.MaxPayloadSize</a></code>.
- Added an option to disable dual-mode sockets for the UDP transport.
- Made the default transport's socket buffer size configurable.
- Added a [TCP transport](xref:Riptide.Transports.Tcp) (primarily for use as a fallback in situations where UDP doesn't work).

## Changes

- Renamed a lot of things (including the base `RiptideNetworking` namespaceâ€”now it's just `Riptide`). For a list of what was renamed, see the [updating to v2 guide](~/manual/updates/guides/updating-to-v2.md#renames-and-replacements).
- Made calling <code><a href="xref:Riptide.Client.Disconnect*">Client.Disconnect()</a></code> invoke the <code><a href="xref:Riptide.Client.Disconnected">Client.Disconnected</a></code> event. Previously, this event was only invoked when the disconnection was not initiated by the client.
- Removed the `isBigArray` parameter from the <code><a href="xref:Riptide.Message">Message</a></code> class's `Add`/`Get` methods. This is now determined automatically.
- Reduced the default maximum message payload size to 1225 bytes (from 1247 bytes) to ensure messages are smaller than the [MTU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_transmission_unit).
- Made <code><a href="xref:Riptide.Client.Connect*">Client.Connect()</a></code> return a `bool` to indicate whether a connection attempt will be made or an issue occurred ([#39](https://github.com/RiptideNetworking/Riptide/issues/39)).
- Completely overhauled the transport system (which resulted in the removal of the `RudpListener`, `RudpServer`, `RudpClient`, and `RudpConnection` classes). For more information on the transport rework and all of the changes involved, see [pull request #56](https://github.com/RiptideNetworking/Riptide/pull/56).
- Made the default transport single-threaded, as the multithreading didn't provide much benefit but caused difficult-to-debug issues.
- Improved error handling.
- Made error messages more descriptive.
- Gave servers authority over which messages are automatically relayed. This is customizable via <code><a href="xref:Riptide.Server.RelayFilter">Server.RelayFilter</a></code>.
- Removed customizable maximum send attempts for messages. In a future update, this system will be replaced by a system which disconnects clients if their connection health deteriorates too much.
- Removed `LanDiscovery` class. It will be overhauled and re-added in a future update.
- Removed unused `DoubleKeyDictionary` class.
- Removed unused `ActionQueue` class.
- Removed unnecessary custom type size constants.
- Made event args' properties readonly fields.

## Fixes

- Fixed some message handler methods not being found ([#44](https://github.com/RiptideNetworking/Riptide/issues/44)).
